# Space-RPG

This is a project that I worked on, attempting to develop a game in the vein of the early "Fallout" series. I used LWJGL to handle the developmen, which means 
all of the graphics are OpenGL. It does support saving and loading maps, traveling between maps, moving a "character" at this point, just a red circle, and combat
between the "player" and enemies on the field.
